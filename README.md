# MS-x-Monotron-expansion
An expansion of the Korg Monotron with EG's, noise source, CV &amp; MIDI

This design is based on the excellent MS-x Project by DJ SoulMachine

https://www.djsoulmachine.com/farbeyondperception/index.html

I updated the EG's to EnvGen8c chips and added two more of them for pitch and amplitude as well as the VCF

I also added a white/pink noise source and a MIDI interface (optional).

I have included the original documentation from DJ SoulMachine and I made some other mods but currently I will have to find these and add them to the documentaion.
