# MS-x-Monotron-expansion
An expansion of the Korg Monotron with EG's, noise source, CV &amp; MIDI

This design is based on the excellent MS-x Project by DJ SoulMachine

https://www.djsoulmachine.com/farbeyondperception/index.html

I updated the EG's to EnvGen8c chips and added two more of them for pitch and amplitude as well as the VCF

I also added a white/pink noise source and a MIDI interface (optional).

I have included the original documentation from DJ SoulMachine and I made some other mods but currently I will have to find these and add them to the documentaion.


# Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO):
- Scale: 32', 16', 8', 4'
- Waveforms: Tri, Saw, Pulse (with PWM), VCO off
- Variable pitch control

# Voltage Controlled low-pass Filter (VCF):
- Cutoff Frequency control
- Peak (Resonance) control
- Keyboard tracking switch

# Voltage Control Amplifier (VCA):
- MS10 VCA clone
- Feedback loop

# Modulation Generator (MG):
- Waveforms: Triangle, Saw & Square
- Frequency control
- Frequency modulation of VCO & VCF

# Envelope Generators (EG):
- Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release
